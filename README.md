# Network Packet Sniffer

A lightweight Python-based network packet sniffer that captures and logs network traffic for analysis.  
This project is intended for educational purposes and helps you understand how packet sniffing works at a basic level.

## ðŸ“œ Features

- Capture network packets on a specified interface (e.g., Wi-Fi, Ethernet)
- Filter packets based on protocol (`arp`, `bootp`, `icmp`, or `all`)
- Limit the number of packets captured or capture for a specific duration
- Save captured packets to a log file for offline analysis
- Runs with administrative/root privileges
- Cross-platform support (Windows/Linux)

3. **Run the script** (with Admin/Root permissions):
    ```bash
    python networkPacket.py
    ```

4. **Follow the prompts**:
    - Enter the network interface (e.g., `Wi-Fi` or `Ethernet`)
    - Enter number of packets or duration
    - Choose protocol (ARP, BOOTP, ICMP, or ALL)
    - Provide a name for the output log file (e.g., `logFile.txt`)

5. **View the captured data**:
    - Open the generated log file to see the captured packet information.
